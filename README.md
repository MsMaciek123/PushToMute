# PushToMute
This is simple script that will mute/unmute your microphone and play sound. You may need to change SOURCE_NAME accordingly (check `pactl list short sources` and find your microphone). \
If you're not using KDE, use `pactl set-source-mute` in script instead of `qdbus`.

Place this file somewhere and add global hotkey to execute it. \
Those sounds are Discord's sounds. You may replace them.
